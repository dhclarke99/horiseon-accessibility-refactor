# horiseon-accessibility-refactor

## Description

The purpose of building this project was to familiarize myself with the html and css elements of a webpage, and to clean up the code to ensure it follows best practices and is easy to follow. By working through this project I am able to see how html and css languages work together, and am able to assist in making the code for this webpage more organized and efficient. 

After cleaning up this file I learned how to specify semantic elements in an index.html file and how to organize the corresponding style.css file so that it flows well with the html code.
